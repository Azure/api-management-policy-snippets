# Azure API Management Policy Snippets

This repository contains policy examples contributed by the product team and the user community. The snippets are meant to be re-used verbatim, provide inspiration or serve as learning aids. Some snippets are parameterized using [Named Values](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-properties) (fka Properties), which look like this `{{some-value}}`. When using such snippets you will have to either define relevant Named Values or replace them with values in place.
